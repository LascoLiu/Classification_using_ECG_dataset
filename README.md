# Classification_using_ECG_dataset
Developed learning-based models for classification using ECG dataset, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), and Random Forest.   
The performance of these models was evaluated using confusion matrices and the area under the ROC curve (AUC).   
After comparing these models, it was found that the SVM model yielded the best results.
