# Classification_using_ECG_dataset
Developed learning-based models for classification using ECG dataset, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest, and NN.

The performance of these models was evaluated using confusion matrices and the area under the ROC curve (AUC).   
After comparing these models, it was found that the SVM model yielded the best results.
NN.ipynb
Developed recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for classifying the sequential data within the dataset, utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures. The RNNs were structured with three layers, employing the ReLU activation function and the Adam optimizer.
